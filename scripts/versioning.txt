v1 - ability to parse tilesheets
v2 - ability to parse a map, circumventing the need for tilesheets. uses packed arrays for ROM which causes "exceeds 2**16 bits" warning
v3 - ability to parse a map, but using unpacked arrays for ROM, which seems to use the same number of LE/registers but with no warnings
         - Total logic elements : 15,022 / 49,760 ( 30 % )
         - Total registers      : 2476
         - Total memory bits    : 11,264 / 1,677,312 ( < 1 % )

also changed from using VRAM (and thus needing ram.mif) to using map_rom (and thus generating that instead).
